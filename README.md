# Corne (crkbd) Keyboard Stuff
For a Wired V3 Cherry [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/).


**This is a Work In Progress**

## Keymap
This features my keymap setup coming from a Swiss QWERTZ keyboard and moving on to Colemak-DH.
When using with Windows, Keyboard is set to US (International) to make accents and umlauts accessible trough alt, which
makes this useable to write English, German and French.
And put stuff like brackets and quotes into convenient places for coding.
