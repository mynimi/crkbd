# Corne (crkbd) Keyboard Stuff
For a Wired V3 Cherry [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/).

This features my keymap setup coming from a Swiss QWERTZ keyboard and moving on to Colemak-DH.
When using with Windows, Keyboard is set tu US (International) to make accents and Umlauts accessible trough alt keys, which
makes this useable to write English, German and French with ease.
And put stuff like brackets and quotes into convenient places for coding.

**This is a Work In Progress**
